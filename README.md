<p> RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) Model provides auto-segmentation and bucket users into categories such as Loyal, Promising, At Risk, etc. based on their behavior. These auto segments can be used in multiple different ways such as user analysis, churn analysis, and campaign effectiveness. RFM can also be used predictive segmentation, customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization.

RFM analysis is a widely used marketing model for behavior-based customer segmentation. This was primarily used in the retail industry and making its way to digital marketing. It groups customers based on their transaction history – how recently, how often and how much did they buy.
